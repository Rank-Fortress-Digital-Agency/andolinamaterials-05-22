            1. A well-manicured lawn.
        </h2>
        <p>
            A beautiful, green lawn is the foundation of any good landscaping design. If your property is in poor condition, it will be one of the first things potential buyers notice – and it could be a dealbreaker. Investing in regular lawn care will pay off when it’s time to sell.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your landscaping company can provide all the services to keep your lawn looking its best, including mowing, edging, fertilizing, and more. In addition to regular maintenance, your landscaping company can also help you with larger projects like installing new plantings or hardscaping features.
